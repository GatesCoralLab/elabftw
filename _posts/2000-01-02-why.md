#### Basically

# because it is open source (and free)

and also because it has a lot of nice features among which :

- works with Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD, etc...
- RFC 3161 compliant timestamping (for intellectual property)
- export experiments in pdf or zip archive
- database to store reagents, protocols or anything you want
- allows customization of status, type of items, colors, *etc*…
- upload any type of files, embed images in the text
- can fit any kind of lab (chemistry, biology, physics, astronomy, *etc*…)
- translated in half a dozen languages already
- did I say it was free ?
