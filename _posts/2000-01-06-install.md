## Install

So you have decided to give a chance to eLab? Great!

Have a look at [the documentation](https://elabftw.rtfd.org). Everything is described precisely.

I don't have time for reading, just let me [download the zip archive](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/archive/master.zip)!

You can also git clone it :

git clone https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw
